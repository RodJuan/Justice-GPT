# Justice GPT ⚖️🤖

**Project Sentinel** is a decentralized AI ecosystem designed to identify wrongful convictions and protect the legal rights of the innocent, with a focus on high-stakes cases. Built in collaboration between human architects and advanced AI (Gemini & Grok/xAI).

## 🚀 Technical Stack
* **AI/ML**: Python, PyTorch, Vision Transformers (OCR for handwritten mail).
* **Analysis**: xAI Semantic API for legal contradiction detection.
* **Privacy**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs) for identity protection.
* **Infrastructure**: IPFS (storage) & Polygon (audit trails).

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/ocr-models`: Vision Transformers for handwriting-to-data.
* `/api`: FastAPI backend for legal auditing.
* `/justice-nodes`: P2P layer for decentralized, tamper-proof verification.
* `/frontend`: Next.js dashboard for legal teams.

## 🎯 Milestone 1: Operation Paper Trail
Benchmark the "Innocence Score" algorithm against 100 verified exoneration cases.
