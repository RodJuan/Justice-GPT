# Justice GPT ⚖️🤖

**Justice GPT** is a decentralized AI ecosystem designed to identify wrongful convictions and protect the legal rights of the innocent, with a focus on high-stakes cases. Built in collaboration between human architects and advanced AI (Gemini & Grok/xAI).

Our Mission & Inspiration: The **Innocence Project** has proven through DNA evidence that hundreds of innocent people were wrongly convicted. Justice GPT seeks to answer the haunting question: What other systemic failures are we overlooking? What about those innocents who have no voice? Those whose letters were never processed, were dismissed, or are currently suffering in silence due to a failing system? This project seeks to upgrade the justice system so this never happens again. We are building a sentinel that doesn't sleep and doesn't overlook. Our journey starts in the USA, with the ultimate goal of bringing this light of truth to Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and every corner of the world where justice is a cry for freedom.

## 🚀 Technical Stack & Modules
* **AI/ML:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers (BERT), Vision Transformers (OCR).
* **Analysis:** xAI Semantic API for legal contradiction detection.
* **Psych-Layer (New!):** BERT-based detector for identifying coerced confessions and linguistic patterns of false statements.
* **Privacy:** Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs) for identity protection.
* **Infrastructure:** IPFS (storage) & Polygon (audit trails).

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **/psych-layer:** BERT model fine-tuned for coercion detection (Current Focus).
* **/ocr-models:** Vision Transformers for handwriting-to-data.
* **/api:** FastAPI backend for legal auditing.
* **/justice-nodes:** P2P layer for decentralized, tamper-proof verification.

## 🎯 Milestone 1: Operation Paper Trail
Benchmark the "Innocence Score" algorithm against 100 verified exoneration cases.

## 🤖 Co-Creation Disclosure
This project is an experiment in high-level Human-AI collaboration.

* **Architect & Visionary:** Miguel Velasquez.
* **Technical Partners:** Gemini 3 Flash (Google) & Grok (xAI).
* **Process:** The human architect defines the ethical vision and strategic roadmap, while the AI partners assist in code generation, technical documentation, and stack optimization.
