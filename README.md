# Justice GPT ⚖️🤖

Project Sentinel is a decentralized AI ecosystem designed to identify wrongful convictions and protect the legal rights of the innocent, with a focus on high-stakes cases. Built in collaboration between human architects and advanced AI (Gemini & Grok/xAI).

## 🚀 Technical Stack & Modules
* **AI/ML:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers (BERT), Vision Transformers (OCR).
* **Analysis:** xAI Semantic API for legal contradiction detection.
* **Psych-Layer (New!):** BERT-based detector for identifying coerced confessions and linguistic patterns of false statements.
* **Privacy:** Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs) for identity protection.
* **Infrastructure:** IPFS (storage) & Polygon (audit trails).

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **/psych-layer:** BERT model fine-tuned for coercion detection (Current Focus).
* **/ocr-models:** Vision Transformers for handwriting-to-data.
* **/api:** FastAPI backend for legal auditing.
* **/justice-nodes:** P2P layer for decentralized, tamper-proof verification.

## 🎯 Milestone 1: Operation Paper Trail
Benchmark the "Innocence Score" algorithm against 100 verified exoneration cases.

## 🤖 Co-Creation Disclosure
This project is an experiment in high-level Human-AI collaboration.

* **Architect & Visionary:** Miguel Velasquez.
* **Technical Partners:** Gemini 3 Flash (Google) & Grok (xAI).
* **Process:** The human architect defines the ethical vision and strategic roadmap, while the AI partners assist in code generation, technical documentation, and stack optimization.
