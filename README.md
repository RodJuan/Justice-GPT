Sentinel Justice ⚖️🤖

Sentinel Justice is a decentralized AI ecosystem designed to identify wrongful convictions and protect the legal rights of the innocent, with a focus on high-stakes cases. Built through a historic collaboration between human architects and advanced AI (Gemini & Grok/xAI).

🌍 Our Mission & Inspiration

The Innocence Project has proven through DNA evidence that hundreds of innocent people were wrongly convicted. Sentinel Justice seeks to answer the haunting question: What other systemic failures are we overlooking? What about those innocents who have no voice? Those whose letters were never processed, were dismissed, or are currently suffering in silence due to a failing system? This project seeks to upgrade the justice system so this never happens again. We are building a Sentinel that doesn't sleep and doesn't overlook. Our journey starts in the USA, with the ultimate goal of bringing this light of truth to Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and beyond—wherever justice is a cry for freedom.

🛡️ Systemic Upgrade Beyond Analysis

While our current focus is the Psych-Layer for letter analysis, Sentinel Justice is designed as a comprehensive judicial upgrade. We aim to replace outdated, bias-prone manual reviews with a decentralized, tamper-proof verification layer. From automated docket auditing to Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) identity protection for whistleblowers, we are building the infrastructure for a justice system that is transparent, proactive, and truly universal.

⚖️ Judicial Integrity Framework (Core Objectives)

Sentinel Justice is engineered to detect and analyze the five primary causes of wrongful convictions identified by the Innocence Project. Our modular architecture systematically addresses these failures:

    1. Eyewitness Misidentification: Consistency-Check module uses cross-referencing algorithms to find temporal and spatial contradictions in testimonies.

    2. Misapplication of Forensic Science: Forensic-Validator audits historical forensic data against modern peer-reviewed scientific standards.

    3. False Confessions: Psych-Layer (Active) utilizes NLP to detect coercion patterns and stress-related linguistic markers.

    4. Official Misconduct: Sentinel-Audit recognizes patterns of Brady violations (withheld evidence) and procedural anomalies.

    5. Coerced Pleas: Plea-Analyzer evaluates the disparity between available evidence and the pressure applied to waive trial rights.

🚀 Technical Stack & Modules

    AI/ML: Python, PyTorch, Transformers (BERT), Vision Transformers (TrOCR).

    Analysis: xAI Semantic API for legal contradiction detection.

    Psych-Layer (New!): BERT-based detector for identifying coerced confessions and linguistic patterns of false statements.

    Privacy: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs) for identity protection.

    Infrastructure: IPFS (storage) & Polygon (audit trails).

📂 Repository Structure

    /psych-layer: BERT model fine-tuned for coercion detection (Current Focus).

    /ocr-models: Vision Transformers for handwriting-to-data conversion.

    /api: FastAPI backend for legal auditing and scoring.

    /justice-nodes: P2P layer for decentralized, tamper-proof verification.

🎯 Milestone 1: Operation Paper Trail

Benchmark the Innocence Score algorithm against 100 verified exoneration cases.
