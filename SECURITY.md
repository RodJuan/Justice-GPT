# Security & Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment
Project Sentinel deals with sensitive legal data. Protecting the identity and dignity of the incarcerated is our highest priority.

## Security Protocols
- **Data Anonymization:** All personal identifiers must be stripped before processing cases in public testing environments.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs):** We are working toward a layer where case validity can be proven without revealing sensitive private data.
- **Reporting Vulnerabilities:** If you find a security flaw, please do not open a public issue. Email [TU CORREO AQUÍ] or DM the architect directly to ensure a coordinated disclosure.

## Ethical AI Use
This project strictly prohibits the use of its code for surveillance, unauthorized profiling, or any activity that harms the legal rights of individuals.
